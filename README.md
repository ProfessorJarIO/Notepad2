# Notepad2
Notepad2 was created using native Windows API (WinAPI) code. 

You should have all the necessary files in order to run and compile the code, but if you do run into trouble, let me know and I will see if I need to add anything else... 

This was a project made by me to learn C/C++ and windows internals. I learned a lot throughout the course of this project. 

You are free to use, modify, and fork the project if you wish!
